MusicRandomizer
=============

This script creates dirs with randomly selected tracks from library of music e.g. iTunes media directory.

It was written to implement "random track clush" for my really bad car media center :)

### How to use

```sh
$ ./MusicRandomizer.py <LIBRARY_DIR> <OUTPUT_DIR> [-n <TRACKS_PER_DIR>]
```

Now supports only *.mp3 tracks
