MusicRandomizer
=============

This script creates dirs with randomly selected tracks from library of music e.g. iTunes media diractory.

It was written to implement "random track clush" for my really bad car media center :)

### How to use

```sh
$ ./MusicRandomizer.py <LIBRARY_DIR> <OUTPUT_DIR> [-n <TRACKS_PER_DIR>]
```
